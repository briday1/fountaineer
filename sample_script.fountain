INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A dark, damp warehouse. Rain drips through a hole in the ceiling, tapping against the concrete floor. Wooden crates are stacked high, casting long shadows.

JOHN
This place gives me the creeps.

LUCY
(whispering)
Stay quiet. We don’t have much time.

MORGAN
(grinning)
I say we move fast.

Suddenly, a **CREAK** echoes from the rafters. Everyone freezes.

HENRY steps out of the darkness, a gun in hand.

HENRY
(smirking)
You weren’t planning to leave without me, were you?

LUCY
Of course not, Henry. We were just getting started.

THE GUARD enters from a side door, hand on his holster.

THE GUARD
Nobody moves.

MORGAN suddenly **lunges** at The Guard, knocking the gun from his hand. A struggle ensues.

HENRY
Now or never, John!

JOHN grabs a duffel bag and **sprints toward the exit**. The others follow, dodging crates as bullets **RICOCHET** off the walls.

EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The crew bursts through a side door into a narrow alley. The sound of **police sirens** grows louder.

LUCY
We need a way out. Now! adfjaslkfjdsalkjls sadljflkdsa sdlkjasdl;j dslifj dkj; sadlkfj dslkjf dskl dslkjf sdaljf aslkdfj dsflkjfsdalj

JOHN scans the alley, spots a rusty fire escape.

JOHN
Up there! Go!

One by one, they **scramble up the ladder** as the sirens grow deafening.

FADE TO BLACK.
